if you break someone's chain and then they fall /wo sword, you get point
more of a ledge to recover from fall in level 2
bigger loose sword recovery hitbox
faster respawn as player count gets lower
8 dir doesn't add much
music keeps vanishing (tab change? nonlooping?)
join bubbles stop bobbing if you change tabs and back
